## Overview
This project implements all core mechanics of the chess game. Currently it allows you to play a game on one machine using a mouse.
Upon selecting a piece, all of its legal moves are highlighted.

## Purpose
The project was designed to teach me object-oriented programming principles in practice. While the implementation may not be ideal in some places, it has been a valuable learning experience. Iâ€™ve also learned that chess implementation is much more complex than I initially expected :)

## Issues
Small bugs are to be expected, though they should not be prevalent or affect gameplay to a large extent.

## How to run
Simply run the Main.java class to run.
